## iPad/iOS Guide
1. The system needs to be iPadOS 15/iOS 15 or above
2. Install userscripts in App Store, Guide：https://github.com/quoid/userscripts#installation
3. Go to `Settings->safari->Extensions`, turn `userscripts` on
4. Create a subdirectory on the file App on the device and put the eHunter executable file into it （download the eHunter executable file：https://github.com/hanFengSan/eHunter/releases)
5. Open userscripts App，and select the subdirectory
6. Open e-hentai on Safari (non-exhentai)，and view a gallery
7. On the left side of the refresh button in the address bar of the browse gallery page, there is an extension icon, click Allow userscripts to access the site. Then there will be a new button to the left of the refresh button, click and make sure eHunter is enabled
8. Refresh the page, then you can enjoy it (maybe need to refresh twice on nhentai)
9. I don't optimize the UX on mobile platform yet, so it may be have a bad UX on iPhone.
